                  <h2 style="color:teal;">Introduction</h2>
									<p style= "font-size: 20px; text-align:left;">The Masadi Forest in Hualien County, Taiwan, forms an ecological corridor between the Coastal and Central Mountain Ranges, facilitating safe animal migration. This study was conducted during the wet season, defined as September to November, and the dry season, defined as December to January. The study area was divided into 30 grids and installed <strong>camera traps </strong> in central locations. Environmental factors, such as tree height, canopy coverage, deadwood, and ground cover, were measured during wet and dry seasons. The study recorded Formosan hare individuals and assessed their relative density using the Occurrence Index. Statistical analysis and <strong> GIS ArcMap </strong> were employed to analyze the hares' habitat preferences and create distribution maps.

  <h2 style="color:teal;">Conclusion</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">Habitat factors are used as independent variables, and the occurrence index of wild rabbits in both seasons is the dependent variable for a regression analysis to determine if there is a significant relationship between wild rabbit occurrence and habitat environment. Under the condition of p-value less than 0.05, during the wet season, wild rabbits appeared more frequently in environments with thinner canopy coverage (p=0.016). In the dry season, they were more frequent in environments with lower ground cover of herbaceous plants (p=0.039). Both seasons had higher densities on the west side compared to the east side of the study area, mainly on the northwest side of the riverbed. In the dry season, their distribution extended widely, including a hotspot on the south side. Regarding microhabitat selection, wild rabbits favored environments with lower ground cover of herbaceous plants during the dry season, possibly because this environment provides less cover. On a larger scale, higher densities were observed in riverbed habitats, which may be due to the relatively natural state of the riverbanks with abundant vegetation, providing cover for rabbits to prefer this habitat.</p>
