                  <h2 style="color:teal;">Introduction</h2>
									<p style= "font-size: 20px; text-align:left;">In Peninsular Malaysia's Pasoh Forest Reserve (PFR), wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations have significantly increased over the years due to reduced predator numbers and changes in land use, including oil palm cultivation. This growth negatively affects tree saplings, as boars build nests, impacting tree density. This study explores the relationship between boar nest areas, damaged saplings, and environmental factors, along with the influence of mud wallow locations on boar behavior.
                                    </p>
									<p style= "font-size: 20px; text-align:left;">Record the wild boar nests and wallows within 4 meters of the vertical distance crossing line. Measure the straight-line distance and angle from the nearest benchmark to the wild boar nests. Categorize nests based on the freshness of overlying branches: Very new, New, Old, and Decomposed. Record their radius and the number of saplings broken within 20 meters for very new nests. Determine whether wallows are used by wild boars based on nearby tracks and mud on leaves, recording radius, distance, and angle to the nearest benchmark. Data analysis is conducted using R and Excel, exploring relationships between nest area and sapling count and associations between wallows, soil types, and terrain using chi-square and correlation tests.</p>

  </figure>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">The study found 159 wild boar nests and 29 wallows in a 17.6-hectare area, with a slight increase in density from 2009 to 2017. While 'Very New' nests were observed, the average saplings per nest didn't significantly differ from previous data. Chi-square tests indicated significant differences in nest distribution among soil types, particularly in 'Wet Alluvium,' but wallows didn't exhibit strong preferences for specific soil types.</p>

  <h2 style="color:teal;">Conclusion</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">The study aimed to understand the relationship between wild boar behavior and ecological factors in the Pasoh Forest Reserve of Peninsular Malaysia. The research investigated wild boar nests, wallows, and their associations with soil types and environmental variables. Results indicated an increasing trend in boar nest density. However, the study found that nest sizes did not correlate with sapling numbers. While it was initially hypothesized that nests and wallows would be influenced by soil types, significant differences were only observed in the 'Wet Alluvium' category for nests, suggesting that soil may play a limited role in nest location preferences.</p>
